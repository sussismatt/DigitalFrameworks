I decided to pull all the House of Representative campaigns that donated to Trump organizations. To calculate this, I first pulled all the congressional candidates' contributions (starting on line 483), then copied those lines and removed duplicates. From there, I created a SUMIF function to pull the collective total contributions from each candidate. 

The results showed me that 32 House congressional candidates donated to Trump-related organizations in 2017/2018. Of those, just 9 gave over $1,000--these were in general very small contributions. 

I found that Bill Shuster, a Pennslyvania Republican, gave by the far most, donating nearly $26 thousand (see line 536). The majority of this--about $20 thousand--all came on November 30, 2017. Shuster is up for re-election next year, and his seat is hotly contested. He won just over 50% of the vote in 2016, and 53% of the vote in 2014. Given that Shuster's district overhwelmingly voted for Trump 69-27%, it makes sense why he might want to cozy up with Trump and win favor ahead of his own election. Public backing from Trump would likely give Shuster the boost he needs to win in what is likely going to be an extremely close race in 2018. 

Shuster's contributions were for space rental fees at the D.C. Trump hotel, where it appears he hosted steak dinners and events (the $20 thousand in November was a dinner at BLT Steakhouse in the hotel.) On top of directly winning favor with Trump by spending money at his hotels as previously mentioned, it's possible that Shuster thought hosting events for his supporters/donors at a hotel with Trump's name would help voters to associate his name with "Trump." His campaign did not respond to comments when the Washington Post reached ou

The next largest donor to Trump organizations, Dana Rohrbacher of California, gave $12.5 thousand--less than half of Shuster's donation. Link to data below:
