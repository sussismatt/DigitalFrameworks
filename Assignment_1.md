# Assignment 1

[Here](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/mar/27/how-socio-economic-disadvantage-varies-area-by-area-in-australia) is my story. It's a piece from The Guardian looking at "socioeconomic disadvantage" region-by-region, using an interactive map paired with text.

The regions are color-coded are sorted by decile which is pretty effective in that it immediately becomes clear which parts of the country are the poorest. The ability to "hover" over each region and see its specific rank is useful as well. However, the map only defines poverty in relative terms. It would be useful if hovering over each reigon was also paired with some objective data about the reigon's economics (e.g. "Outback: Decile=2, Rank=343/2184, Unemployment rate=5%"). 

There are objective measures available through a drop-down list that cover a range of demographic filters, such as marriage rate and average income. However, these other filters don't really feel relevant to the topic at hand. For example, when you filter the map by percent of females married, it no longer shows you socioeconomic status. Instead, you get a totally new map that only tracks marriage rates. An article showing how those other factors **correlate** with socioeconomic status would be more interesting and relevant for me.

On the more positive side, I appreciate that the article has a list in text form below the map listing the most and least advantaged counties. Extremes in any list are always the most interesting data points, so it's convenient to have them all in one accessible place.
