Today, England announced the 23 players who would be representing their country in the 2018 World Cup next month. These players will likely face high amounts of pressure coming into the competition given their country's recent perforances. In 2014, England was eliminated during the World Cup group stages, and during the 2016 Euros, they were humiliated by major underdog Iceland--a country with a population of just 330,000 people compared to England's 53 million (160x larger than Iceland). As such, expectations are high for English coming into 2018. 

While more and more soccer players are extending the lives of their careers in recent years into their mid 30s, youth is still a crucial factor in a team's ability to succeed. There is a wide variety in the ages of players on the English team, ranging from 19 to 32. At 19, Trent Alexander-Arnold is making his debut as the youngest player on the team--a "wunderkind" right back currently playing for Liverpool. On the other end, Ashley Young and Gary Cahill are both 32, making this likely their last World Cup appearance. 

The average age of England's team is 25, making it a relatively young team by European standards and meaning most players on this squad will likely return to at least two more World Cups (in 2022 and 2026) if 2018 proves to be another year of dissapointment for the English.
