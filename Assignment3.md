I'm curious to learn more about the biggest individual political donors. Specifically, I want to know what industries they made their money in, and how those industries correlate with the party to which they choose to donate. For example, are most donors who made their money in financial services Republican donors? Are most donors who made their money in healthcare Demoratic donors? I could turn this into a data-driven story about the political leanings of top donors in different industries, perhaps visually displaying the different industries across a gradient/political spectrum.

Specifically, I want to know: donor name, total donations, preferred political party, industry.

To collect the data, I'd start by using the FEC's data which they make publicly available (latest data from 3/29/18). Then, for each individual donor, I'll research where they made their money by looking up their biograhpies online. Because most billionaires are well-known, and many are either company executives or Board members, their bios are very readily available with a bit of searching.
