Think about an area you're interested in, and come up with a dataset you wish existed. Then submit the following:

A description of the question you're curious about, and an explanation about how this data could turn into a story. (Imagine this as your justification to your editor as to why this is worth your time)
A list of the things you want to know about any data point
An explanation of how you'd go about collecting that data (you don't actually have to do it on an ongoing basis, especially if it involves staking something out, just tell me how you would do it).
A table including at least five data points in this dataset
You can put your data in a google sheet (in which case, put the link in your homework) or make a table directly in the document you submit.
Your dataset cannot be something you can just find elsewhere. For example, do not pick something like "all earthquakes above magnitude 7 in the US" because someone (the USGS) already has exactly that data collection. If you want to do earthquakes, add more information such as the number of injuries and deaths reported in the media, and possibly include a link to the relevant media report as one of your columns.

I'm curious to learn more about the biggest individual political donors. Specifically, I want to know what industries they made their money in, and how those industries correlate with the party to which they choose to donate. For example, are most donors who made their money in financial services Republican donors? Are most donors who made their money in healthcare Demoratic donors? I could turn this into a data-driven story about the political leanings of top donors in different industries, perhaps visually displaying the different industries across a gradient/political spectrum.

Specifically, I want to know: donor name, total donations, preferred political party, industry.

To collect the data, I'd start by using the FEC's data which they make publicly available (latest data from 3/29/18). Then, for each individual donor, I'll research where they made their money by looking up their biograhpies online. Because most billionaires are well-known, and many are either company executives or Board members, their bios are very readily available with a bit of searching.
