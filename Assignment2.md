Hi,

As we discussed, I'd like to do a data story tracking the progress of schools that received 2010 school improvement grants under the Obama administration to see how their performances have improved since. Have these schools benefitted from the grant money they've receieved? The data is provided by the federal government here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-improvement-2010-grants. Given that it's directly published by the Department of Education, I feel confident in its accuracy. To be sure, I looked up several of the schools on the list to make sure that they did in fact receive grant money. For the schools I looked up, I was able to find their grant applications. For example, here is the application from Capital Heights Jr. High in Alabama: https://www2.ed.gov/programs/sif/summary/alapp.pdf. The data appears to check out.

However, my work obviously requires an additional data source to track the school's performance--it's not enough to just know which schools got grants. I found https://www.schooldigger.com/ which aggregates data from the DoE. To make sure this data is accurate, I plugged in Hogarth Kingeekuk Sr. Memorial School, the first school on the DoE's grant list. SchoolDigger said its student:teacher ratio was 13.2. I decided to check that against the actual DoE information on the school (https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/) and found it was the same. I repeated this exercise with several data points and it all checked out, leading me to believe SchoolDigger does in fact correctly aggregate the data.

Overall, I am confident that the DoE appropriately listed the schools that received grants, and that the performance aggregator is accurate as well.

Regards,
Matt
