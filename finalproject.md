WASHINGTON—While the exact origins of the rule remain unknown, the ironclad fashion rule that one should only wear white clothing during the summer emerged sometime in the late 1800s to early 1900s among rich Western socialites.

As times change, so do traditions and social norms. This led me to wonder: Do Americans still abide by the rule of white clothing? 

I tracked the number of men and women wearing white clothing at Don Tito’s, a popular rooftop bar in Arlington, Virginia in order to determine whether the residents of Arlington dressed in a manner which represented a centuries-old fashion faux pas. 

**Methodology**

The rule traditionally holds that summer clothing is to be worn between Memorial Day in May, and Labor Day in September. As such, I recorded the number of men and women wearing white vs. colored clothing every day for the week leading up to Memorial Day Weekend, the weekend itself, and several days after. 

From my seventh floor patio in the apartment building next to Don Tito’s, I have a near-perfect bird’s eye view of the Don Tito’s rooftop. Each day at approximately 5 p.m. during happy hour, I counted the patrons to see how many were wearing at least one article of white clothing. Wearing anything white (other than shoes) counted—for example, a woman in a blue shirt with white pants or vice versa would count as wearing white. While shoes historically were considered an article of clothing that should only be white after Memorial Day, I was unable to accurately judge shoe color from my balcony so I chose to exclude them from the results. 

I divided the results between men and women, and during my observation period there were no ambiguous gender cases.

There is one staircase leading to the rooftop, making it easy to see who comes and goes during the approximately 2-3 minutes of my counting. I excluded any new entrants, and made sure to count any patrons before they left down the stairs to get a “screenshot” of the bar at 5 p.m. I also took pictures each day on my phone, so I could later compare my count to what the picture captured.

It should also be noted that the Don Tito’s patrons are not necessarily representative of Arlington residents or Americans overall. The patrons were mostly millennials, and the overwhelming majority appeared to be in their 20s or 30s. They were mostly white—about 80 percent. Lastly, many may be more social or extroverted than the average American given their patronage of a noisy bar during the week. Any of these factors may have influenced the results relative to the general population.

The Don Tito’s patrons appeared to abide by the rule of white clothing. While only about 15 percent of men and women wore white on a given day before Memorial Day Weekend, approximately one-third of patrons were wearing white during and after the weekend. In other words, the proportion of people wearing white roughly doubled entering summer.

While both men and women followed the rule, the time at which they began wearing white clothing varied. Many men started wearing white as soon as the weekend began, while women tended to wait for Memorial Day itself, on Monday.

By the Friday of Memorial Day Weekend, the number of men wearing white already jumped to nearly 30 percent, and reached its peak of 38 percent by Monday. 

Meanwhile, while there was a slight uptick in women wearing white as the weekend begun, they appeared to wait until Monday, May 28th before wearing white in large numbers. While just 23 percent of women wore white on Friday, it rose to 37 percent by the end of the long weekend. 

“The whole weekend is basically Memorial Day to me,” said Kyle Mahoney, a 23-year-old Arlington resident and a frequent attendee of Don Tito’s happy hour. “Since I already bought some clothing for this summer, I figured I might as well start wearing it now on this nice weekend.”

For some of the female patrons, they felt it more appropriate to wait until Monday.

“Growing up as a kid, we’d always have a family barbeque on Monday where lots of people wore white,” said 24-year-old Arlington resident Alex Moore. “So this year I felt like it made sense to save my white outfit for Memorial Day itself since we had a whole day of activities planned.”

Rainy weather on several days—May 18, 22 and 28—did not appear to materially affect the results. Both May 18 and May 22 saw slightly under one-fifth of patrons wearing white—generally average for before Memorial Day. And May 28 was Memorial Day itself, so the uptick in people wearing white was not a surprise. However, the total number of patrons was far lower on rainy days, with fewer than 40 people showing up on those days compared to the nearly 100 people who showed up each day during the relatively sunny weekend.

While the data is limited, the number of people wearing white dropped off after Memorial Day ended. On Tuesday, just 29 percent of men and 25 percent of women wore white. This was lower than the weekend, but remained above the level of people wearing white prior to Memorial Day. 

“A lot of our summer clothes start selling as early as March, but they start really coming off the shelves around this time of year,” said Sophie Guss, a sales associate at Nordstrom’s in Arlington. “So even though summer hasn’t officially started, this is right about the time everybody starts wearing those new clothes.”

It remains to be seen whether the day-drinkers of Don Tito’s will continue to wear white at similar levels throughout the summer—but at least for the period around Memorial Day weekend, the old rule regarding wearing white appears to be alive and well.
